<h1 align="left">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Yongyi (Colin) Zang</h1>

I'm currently an undergraduate student at University of Rochester, and working under supervision of Prof. Zhiyao Duan at AIR Lab.

I could probably be categorized as a web developer. For now.

I'm a composer and arranger, fluent in the language of chinese popular music... But I'm intrigued more by indie and jazz music. I studied classical piano as a child for 6 years, making me fluent in synth and keyboard, and somewhat fluent in writing for guitar, drums and bass. And very good at sitting still in front of a keyboard all day long.

I have an online music channel, where I make music with my finger and my face to attract innocent eyeballs. With a negative contribution from my face.

Thanks for coming here! I hope you are having a wonderful time looking at my code. Have a good day!
